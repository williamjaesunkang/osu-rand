random beatmap &amp; player selector ( my personal intro to discord bots &amp; python )

A simple fun discord bot that can randomly select beatmaps and find random players for you!
i am still learning the in's and out's of python, but i felt like this was something fun that i could do in my free time and to help me learn to .

current contributors to osu!rand ( hopefully there will be more people to help double check and iron out all the bugs ) :

- poison @chocomint ice#0002
- benji @Benji#8080

this project has only just started and will continue to grow!
thank you to anyone who is willing to support and has already supported this project :D

NOTICE: This bot was originally created in the summer of 2020. It has an already existing repository on a previously used account, but has been moved to this account to better centralize my body of work.
